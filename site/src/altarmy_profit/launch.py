"""Starting a scheduled job on demand: the Admin page's Run now (`POST /api/admin/jobs/ingest`).

Hosted, the API starts the environment's Cloud Run job (`CloudRunJobs`: the jobs `deploy/deploy.sh` defines,
with `CLOUD_RUN_LOCATION` and `JOB_PREFIX` set on the service; its service account needs `roles/run.invoker`
on them, `deploy/setup.sh job-runner ENV`), never the job's work itself: a job has more memory than the
service, and Cloud Run throttles an instance's CPU once it has answered. In development (a SQLite
database) the work runs in a thread of the API (`InProcessJobs`). Either way the run is recorded in
`job_runs` like a scheduled one (`jobs.recording`), so the Admin page shows it.
